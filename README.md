# THREADS-VS-PROCESS-comparisons-using-Sorting-Algorithms

## Description
This a Operating System project that uses different sorting algorithms to show the difference between Threads and Process completion time. This project uses Open MP (OMP)
library for threads and simple .C program for Processes.

## Prerequiste
* C-Language
* Data Structures
* LINUX
 
## Installation 
* Provide the input file or you can just enter Numbers manually
* Compile the code on Linux with OMP extension
* Run the compiled code for output
 
## Objectives
* To understand the differences between processes and threads in terms of performance and memory usage.
* To implement different sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, selection, quick sort) using C language.
* To measure and compare the total time taken by CPU to sort an array using processes and threads.
* To analyze and present the results in a clear and understandable way
